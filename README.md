![](https://journaldev.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020/02/min_heap_binary_tree_index.png)
# Problem
company A needs to export its product, but consumers always prioritize choosing the lightest-weight of product. So we need to use data structure capable of sorting the lightest-weight products on top.
# Approach
use min-heap data structure to push the product that has lightest-weight on top

# Technique
using [go fake](github.com/brianvoe/gofakeit/v6) to fake product and the weight of product.
